##-	Check if the command entered contains the full-path or if the command entered
	is just the command name. If full-path, do not append the paths from the
	environment variable PATH.

##-	Get 'echo' and 'env' working.

##-	If you type "x=5", then x must be added to the environment. Any assignation
	must be handled. E.G: TEST="The String"; echo $TEST; -- This should print
	"The String" without the quotes.

##-	Check functionality for 'cd'. Specifically 'cd ~', 'cd -', 'cd --', 'cd'

##-	When input is received, you will need to check it for pipes, redirects and command line seperators. i.e. |, >, <, >>, << and ;
	The input may or may not have spaces in between commands, so you will need to handle this carefully.

##-	CTRL-L must run the command 'clear'
