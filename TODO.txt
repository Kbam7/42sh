##-	-Check if the command entered contains the full-path or if the command entered
	  is just the command name. If full-path, do not append the paths from the
	  environment variable PATH.
	-Check ft_select or a previous project for code that reads '/' in paths and
	  adds something to it or does somwthing else with the path. This will be usefull
	  for checking if a path is being used to execute ls or anthother command, or if
	  the string is a raw command. e.g "cd ./path" and not "/bin/cd ./path"
					   "./21sh" or "21sh", both should execute.


##-	Get 'echo' and 'env' working.

##-	If you type "x=5", then x must be added to the environment. Any assignation
	must be handled. E.G: TEST="The String"; echo $TEST; -- This should print
	"The String" without the quotes.

##-	Check functionality for 'cd'. Specifically 'cd ~', 'cd -', 'cd --', 'cd'

##-	When input is received, you will need to check it for pipes, redirects and command line seperators. i.e. |, >, <, >>, << and ;
	The input may or may not have spaces in between commands, so you will need to handle this carefully.

##-	CTRL-L must run the command 'clear'
