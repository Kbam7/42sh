##-	The word following the redirection operator ('<word || >word') is subjected to brace expansion,
	tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal,
	filename expansion, and word splitting. If it expands to more than one word, Bash reports an error.

##-	If you type "x=5", then x must be added to the environment. Any assignation
	must be handled. E.G: TEST="The String"; echo $TEST; -- This should print
	"The String" without the quotes.

##-	CTRL-L must run the command 'clear'
